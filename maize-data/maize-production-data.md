# Maize Production Information

## Soils
- Maize performs well on well drained, well aerated, deep warm __**loam**__ and __**silt loam**__ soils.  
- Clay soils need heavy application of fertilizers and deep cultivation is needed to improve drainage and improve maize production.  
- pH for maize:  
1. 5.0-7.0 - __common for maize__.  
2. 6.0-7.0 - __optimum__.  

- Above or below 5.0-6.0 results to nutrient deficiency and mineral toicity.  
- Acidic soils require liming before maize production to enhance yield.  

## Temperatures
1. 30-34C - __optimum__.  
2. **Cool temperatures lengthen the growing period**.  
3. 5C < T > 45C - __death of maize__.  

## Fertilizers  
- Young maize plants require **higher amounts of phosphorous** in the early stages.
- **Deficiency symptoms** usually occur under __**cool and wet conditions**__.  
- **Leaves are dark green with reddish-purple tips and margins**.  

- **Potassium deficiency** is initially noted as __yellow leaf margins__.  
- To addres the deficieny **top dressing of potassium is done.**  

- Rainfed maize requires 80-100kg nitrogen and 45kg phosphorous.  
- **Deficiencies in nitrogen** give rise to young plants that are __pale, light green or yellow__.  

- Irrigated maize apply 120-150kg nitrogen and 60-80kg phosphorous.  

- **Zinc deficiency** is characterized by __light streaks or bands between the veins from the leaf base to the tip__.  

## Maize varieties  
1. __**Highland maize**__
