# Maize production

## Planting depth
- 2-3 cm adequate for most soil  
- 5-10 cm recommended for __dry planting__.  
- Factors affecting actual depth include:  
1. Soil type  
2. Seed bed condition  
3. Moisture  

## Soils
- Maize performs well on well drained, well aerated, deep warm __**loam**__ and __**silt loam**__ soils.  
- Clay soils need heavy application of fertilizers and deep cultivation is needed to improve drainage and improve maize production.  
- pH for maize:  
1. 5.0-7.0 - common for maize.  
2. 6.0-7.0 - optimum.  

- Above or below 5.0-6.0 results to nutrient deficiency and mineral toicity.  
- Acidic soils require liming before maize production to enhance yield.  

## Temperatures
1. 30-34C - optimum.  
2. Cool temperatures lengthen the growing period.  
3. 5C < T > 45C - death of maize.  

- **Deficiency symptoms** usually occur under __**cool and wet conditions**__.  
- To addres the deficieny **top dressing of potassium is done.**
